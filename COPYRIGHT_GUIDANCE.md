# Copyright Guidance for Audio Files

## Important Legal Considerations

### MIT License and Audio Files

**MIT License applies to YOUR code/repository structure, NOT to the audio files.**

- ✅ MIT License: Covers the repository setup, README, any scripts
- ❌ MIT License: Does NOT cover copyrighted audio files from other artists

### Copyright Issues

**Using copyrighted audio without permission is copyright infringement**, even if:
- ❌ You give credit
- ❌ You don't monetize
- ❌ You don't put it in an app store
- ❌ It's for educational/political purposes

**Public GitHub repository = public distribution**, which can increase legal risk.

## Your Options

### Option 1: Use Royalty-Free/CC-Licensed Audio (SAFEST)
- ✅ Use Creative Commons licensed music
- ✅ Use royalty-free music sites (Freesound, Incompetech, etc.)
- ✅ Get explicit permission from artists
- ✅ Use music that's in the public domain

### Option 2: Fair Use (RISKY - depends on jurisdiction)
Fair use is a legal defense, not a right. Factors include:
- Purpose (educational/political can help)
- Nature of copyrighted work
- Amount used
- Effect on market value

**Risk**: Fair use is determined case-by-case in court. Not guaranteed protection.

### Option 3: Get Permission
- Contact artists directly
- Get written permission
- Specify usage terms

### Option 4: Separate Licensing for Audio
- Keep MIT License for code/repo
- Add separate LICENSE-AUDIO.md with:
  - Disclaimer that audio files are copyrighted by original artists
  - Credit information
  - Statement that audio is used with permission/fair use
  - Users should not redistribute audio files

## Recommendation for Your Situation

### For the GitHub Repository:

1. **Keep MIT License** for the repository structure/code
2. **Add a LICENSE-AUDIO.md** file that:
   - States audio files are copyrighted by original artists
   - Lists credits for all audio
   - Includes disclaimer about usage
   - Notes that audio is not covered by MIT License

3. **Add credits in README.md**:
   - List all audio sources
   - Link to original artists
   - Note usage terms

### Example LICENSE-AUDIO.md:

```markdown

## Alternative: Host Audio Elsewhere

If you're concerned about copyright:
- Host audio on a private server (not public GitHub)
- Use a service that allows copyrighted content
- Keep audio files out of public repositories

## My Recommendation

**For your GitHub repository:**
1. ✅ Use MIT License (for repo structure)
2. ✅ Add LICENSE-AUDIO.md with copyright disclaimers
3. ✅ Add comprehensive credits in README
4. ✅ Consider if you can replace some audio with CC-licensed alternatives

**This protects you better than just MIT License alone.**
