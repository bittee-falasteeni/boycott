# Fix 404 Error - Step by Step

## The Problem
404 means the files aren't in the GitHub repository yet. Let's fix this.

## Step 1: Check if Repository Was Cloned

Run this to check:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Bittee
ls -la | grep bittee
```

If you don't see a `bittee` folder, the clone didn't work.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository (Fresh Start)

If the folder doesn't exist or is empty:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Bittee
rm -rf bittee  # Remove if exists (fresh start)
git clone https://github.com/bittee-falasteeni/bittee.git
cd bittee
```

## Step 3: Copy Audio Files

```bash
cp ../bittee-falasteeni/public/assets/audio/*.webm .
```

## Step 4: Verify Files Are There

```bash
ls -1 *.webm | wc -l
```

Should show: `27`

## Step 5: Add, Commit, and Push

```bash
git add *.webm
git commit -m "Add audio assets"
git push -u origin main
```

**Important:** If you get an error about branch, try:
```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Step 6: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/bittee-falasteeni/bittee
2. You should see all 27 `.webm` files listed
3. Click on one file to verify it's there

## Step 7: Test URL Again

After confirming files are on GitHub, try:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bittee-falasteeni/bittee/main/bittee-mawtini1.webm
```

Or if your branch is `master`:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bittee-falasteeni/bittee/master/bittee-mawtini1.webm
```

## Alternative: Upload via GitHub Web Interface

If command line isn't working:

1. Go to: https://github.com/bittee-falasteeni/bittee
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag all `.webm` files from `~/Desktop/Bittee/bittee-falasteeni/public/assets/audio/`
4. Click "Commit changes"
5. Wait a few seconds, then test the URL
