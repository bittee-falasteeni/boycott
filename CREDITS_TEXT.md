## Folder Structure Explanation

**Why there are two folders:**

1. **`bittee-falasteeni/`** - Your main development folder
   - Contains source code (TypeScript, Vite config, etc.)
   - This is where you make changes and build the game
   - Location: `~/Desktop/Bittee/bittee-falasteeni/`

2. **`bittee/`** - GitHub repository folder
   - Created when we cloned your GitHub repository
   - Contains the built game files (from `dist` folder)
   - This is what gets uploaded to GitHub Pages
   - Location: `~/Desktop/Bittee/bittee/`

**When was it created?**
- The `bittee` folder was created when we tried to clone the GitHub repository to upload files
- It's the local copy of your GitHub repository

**Do you need to re-upload index.html?**
- **YES** - After these changes, you need to rebuild and re-upload:
  1. Run `npm run build` (already done)
  2. Copy new `dist` files to `bittee` folder
  3. Re-upload to GitHub (or just the changed files)

The info icon and credits panel are new features, so the built files need to be updated.
